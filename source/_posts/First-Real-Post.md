Hello world, my name is Tom, and I'm debating starting a personal blog of sorts.  It will mostly be related to programming, but will also house some of my own opinions and thoughts on matters of interest.  I don't have a lot to say for this first post, but I plan on creating a post soon with different ideas that I'm going to explore and will hopefully keep up to date throughout this experiment.  

Hopefully I'll be able to create some interesting and enjoyable articles for people to read, thanks!
