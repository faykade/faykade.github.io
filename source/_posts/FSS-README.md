Build a Full Stack Strawpoll, start to finish.  This project is intended to teach the basics of a traditional client/server model using Node.js and Express to create a REST API backed by MongoDB.  Then, after building up the server side, we will using traditional front end technologies like HTML/CSS/Javascript to interact with the server.  Eventually, the plan is to link this up in another tutorial to create a Hexo plugin that will insert a strawpoll on a blog post.
